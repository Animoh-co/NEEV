            <p> Our aim at Neev regarding team selection is to build a strong team and is based on the following parameters : teamwork, attitude, ability, commitment and sportsmanship. We also ensure that students imbibe the valuable qualities of cooperation, coordination, health, leadership, discipline, perseverance, grit, risk-taking, integrity and determination that enable them to become confident, caring and useful members of the local, national and global communities.

                We run a range of sports activities at different age levels for both boys and girls. Through a trial process, we select the students that can be part of the After-School Sports Activity. From the pool of selected students, the coaches identify the students who can be part of the school teams based on ability and attitude. Parents can talk to the coaches to understand the progress their child is making or understand how he/she can improve going forward, but a parent should not try to influence team selection.</p>

Students should be intrinsically and extrinsically motivated to take on challenges to build knowledge and understanding of the world. Thus, create path to be lifelong learners."

      Ms. Shanthi began her teaching career wanting to explore young minds and understand how they learn, at the Air Force school, Kumbhigram, Silchar [Assam]. As a part of the Air force culture she learned to adapt and grow in a new environment. After moving to Bangalore, for 2 years she worked as a K1 teacher, at Presidency school before moving to Neev in 2008. At Neev she began her career as a K2 teacher at the Whitefield branch. In 2011, when Neev started Grade 1, she took over as the Grade 1 teacher. 3 years later moved to Grade 2 and eventually became the grade level coordinator for Grade 1 and 2, before becoming the Lower Elementary Coordinator. As a part of teaching and learning she has conducted workshops for teachers on Classroom Management, Co-teaching and Making Thinking Visible. Her interest in Math drove her to understand the math curriculum and explore teaching math through inquiry, while maintaining the rigour. She has created Math Modules to present the same to the teachers. She holds a Bachelor’s Degree of Arts from St. Francis College, Hyderabad and a teaching diploma from Cambridge International Diploma for Teachers and Learners, UK. <br>

  <p class="p_modal"> "Currently, at the junction at which we (at Neev) are, there are limitless possibilities that we have to ace to truly become the excellence in reimagining education in a changing India. We have to stay hungry and stay foolish as an ecology of learners, with a big craving for new learning journeys, sound, and sustainable practice. For me, the role of MYPC at Neev is of a practitioner, who should truly be a connector or an umbilical cord between teaching and learning practices of PYP and DP, with the celebration of interdisciplinary and international mindedness."

    A mechanical engineer by qualification and currently pursuing his MA in Education (M.Ed) from Bath University, Mr. Vineet has developed a logical mind with his indulgence in science and mathematics during his school education and engineering degree, but at the same time, also cherishes the free limitless thoughts and diverse perspectives of humanities, arts, and literature. In the last 15 years of his career, he has adapted multiple times, starting as mechanical engineering, to a software programmer, further on to become a full-time social entrepreneur in art education sector, to a drama teacher, to the HOD for performing arts, and finally to be the MYP Coordinator at Neev. He has always been eager towards learning the ways of doing the job most effectively and efficiently as his strength lies in deep inquiry, research, documentation, operations, and solution design.
    
    A scientific thinker and a creative facilitator at heart, he is a learner who appreciates the depth and width of knowledge and skill-based inquiry, which are designed to be rigorous and sustainable in practice. He believes in making students informed and capable of taking ownership of their learning and constantly reflecting on how they are changing and evolving to lead an impactful life with blissful nourishment at every moment. He loves the transdisciplinary approach of PYP and is constantly seeking all inspiration and appetite for the depth from DP, it's structured and meaningfully planned rigor, which truly prepares students for a challenging and constantly changing future.
    
    Also, to truly sustain these two programs of IB, he as the MYP coordinator believes in the need for the right balance of curriculum design, assessments, pedagogical practices, pastoral care, and understanding of our learners in an international-minded context through MYP. The right balance of nurture and challenge, of care and push, of wondering and deep thinking, reading and experiencing, of focus and perspectives.<br>

It should be driven by the child’s own curiosity, where the child takes complete ownership for enriching one’s learning, understanding significant ideas, working towards individual goals and moulding themselves into resilient life long learners. It is upto us, to facilitate and equip them with the necessary tools of strong inquiry base and learning practices. We should focus, on what works best to help them master a range of skills, develop personal attitudes and most importantly, emerge as compassionate human beings.”
